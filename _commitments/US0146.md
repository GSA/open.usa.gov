1) The Federal Government commits to implementing this proclamation, including by issuing certificates to eligible applicants who were convicted or charged with marijuana possession.

2) In addition, President Biden has asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to initiate a process to review how marijuana is scheduled under Federal law.

3) Last, the Federal Government will continue to encourage Governors to follow the Federal Government’s lead with regard to State offenses, since most marijuana prosecutions take place at the State level."
