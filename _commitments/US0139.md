1) Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice commits to the following additional steps to bolster openness and transparency through the FOIA... Issuance of an updated FOIA Self-Assessment Toolkit, originally issued in 2017, to reflect, among other things, additional milestones for proactive disclosures, use of technology, and requirements of the Attorney 16 General’s new FOIA Guidelines.

2) Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice commits to the following additional steps to bolster openness and transparency through the FOIA... Leading a Chief FOIA Officer Council working group that will collaborate with the Office of Government Information Services at the National Archives and Records Administration, the Office of Shared Services & Performance Improvement at the Government Services Administration, and the Business Standards Council to develop shared FOIA business standards. The shared business standards will make it easier for agencies to acquire FOIA technology and, in turn, improve efficiency and consistency in processing requests across the Federal Government. 

3) Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice commits to the following additional steps to bolster openness and transparency through the FOIA... Enhancement of the user experience on FOIA.gov, the Federal Government’s central website for FOIA, by developing an interactive tool to help members of the public more easily locate records that are already available online or find the right agency to submit their FOIA requests when information is not already posted online."
