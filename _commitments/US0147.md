1) Executive Order 14074 requires the Department of Justice to establish a National Law Enforcement Accountability Database that includes information related to law enforcement officer terminations, de-certifications, criminal convictions, resignations, sustained complaints for serious misconduct, civil judgments, and commendations. The EO requires federal law enforcement agencies to report this information to the database, but it is voluntary for state and local agencies to submit information.

The Justice Department is currently making design decisions about the database to ensure that it can properly receive this information, while addressing the privacy, security, and due process concerns identified in the EO. Recognizing the many important questions the Department needed to answer, including the scope of available data and existing databases on this topic and the desirability and feasibility of different models, the Department hired a subject-matter expert to conduct a feasibility study and provide options and recommendations for how to design, set up, and implement the database.

Over the course of 6 months, the expert reviewed best practices and possible designs for a database that can accurately track officer decertification and misconduct as outlined in the EO, while protecting privacy and respecting appropriate due process protections for officers. After reviewing the expertâ€™s feasibility study, the Department is in the process of making design decisions regarding its establishment. These decisions are ongoing."
