1) Over the coming year, the Office of Management and Budget commits to supporting Federal agencies in both of these steps, including by developing and sharing burden assessment and reduction tools and resources with Federal agencies and through the review of paperwork requests under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

2) The Administration also commits to applying a bur- den-reducing lens to implementation of major initiatives, as it did with the implementation of the application for student loan debt relief launched in October 2022. 

3) The Administration will engage with civil society to identify high-priority programs to target for administrative burden reduction efforts, including engagement through the U.S. Department of Justiceâ€™s Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable, as further outlined in the Equal Justice Under the Law section below."
