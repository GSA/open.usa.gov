DEA, BOP, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have partnered to provide Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) treatment in all 97 BOP facilities. MOUD treatment, as defined by SAMHSA, is buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone used to treat OUD to short-acting opioids such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, as well as semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone. These medications are safe to use for months, years, or even a lifetime. DEA’s Diversion Control Division, with its’ Controlled Substances Act (CSA) authority, has completed the registration process for the 97 BOP facilities involved in the MAT program  to allow them to prescribe MOUD. At this time, BOP and SAMHSA are working on rolling out this initiative.
