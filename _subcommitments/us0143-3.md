DEA, BOP, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have partnered to provide Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) treatment in all 96 BOP facilities. MOUD treatment, as defined by SAMHSA, is buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone used to treat OUD to short-acting opioids such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, as well as semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone. All 96 BOP facilities have completed the DEA registration process and have received certification through SAMHSA to allow them to dispense MOUD.
