aug_2023_progress: DEA, BOP, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have partnered to provide Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) treatment in all 96 BOP facilities. MOUD treatment, as defined by SAMHSA, is buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone used to treat OUD to short-acting opioids such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, as well as semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone. All 96 BOP facilities have completed the DEA registration process and have received certification through SAMHSA to allow them to dispense MOUD.

Progress Update: 

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) partnered with DEA and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on expanding Opioid treatment. The Federal Bureau of Prisons worked to ensure that each of their facilities are equipped and trained to provide in-house medication-assisted treatment (MAT) (White House, SOTU). In addition to an original 7 full Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) certified within the BOP at the beginning of 2023, DEA and SAMHSA worked to convert 87 of 89 BOP medication units to full, independent OTPs. These now hold provisional certifications with the ability to provide services and will begin accreditation processes later in 2024 as they become eligible.
