Progress Update: 

The First Step Act or FSA (Public Law 115-39) passed on December 18, 2018. It requires the Attorney General (AG) to develop a risk and needs assessment system for BOP to assess the recidivism risk and criminogenic needs of all federal prisoners and to place prisoners in recidivism reducing programs and productive activities to address their needs and reduce this risk. This Open Government National Action Plan sub-commitment has been completed with creation of the PATTERN recidivism risk tool, the SPARC-13 needs assessment, and the publication of the initial First Step Act annual report. This work now moves into an operations and maintenance stage where the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Prisons will continue to work to make incremental improvements to data it collects and the process by which it complies with the First Step Act. This progres will be detailed in future First Step Act annual reports.
