Progress Update: 

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is very proud of the work we have accomplished since the 988 suicide and crisis care hotline was fully opperational in July 2022. Since that time, the 988 suicide and crisis care hotline has received and routed about 8.1 million calls, texts, and chats. The 988 Lifeline crisis counselors are trained to help reduce the intensity of a situation for the person seeking help and connect them to additional local resources, as needed, to support their wellbeing. Since the launch we have expanded the ways the public can interface with the system to include call, texts, and chats, and we continue to work tirelessly with our federal partners to increase capacity and decreased wait times; infact from Nov 1 - 30, 2023, 88% of all calls were answered within 32 seconds, which is a second faster than then the time period in 2022.
