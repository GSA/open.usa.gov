aug_2023_progress: OMB encouraged agencies to adopt an open and transparent approach to collaborative program design, including early and ongoing engagement with agency inspectors general to identify risks and risk-mitigation opportunities upfront while strengthening internal controls and preventing waste and fraud. In addition, OMB worked with agencies and the agency inspector generals to identify significant BIL programs that would benefit from a Joint Review Meeting which would include an in-depth upfront discussion of program design, risk mitigation strategies, financial controls, and data, tracking, and reporting.

Progress Update: 

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) continues to work with agency inspectors general to identify risks and risk-mitigation opportunities upfront while strengthening internal controls and preventing waste and fraud. As of February 15, 2023 the White House has held 13 Joint Program review meetings which include an in-depth upfront discussion of program design, risk mitigation strategies, financial controls, and data, tracking, and reporting. White House leadership also meets monthly with Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) leadership on areas of mutual interest to help ensure any issues are addressed early, and ensure a fair and accurate accounting of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) execution.
