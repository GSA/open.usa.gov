Progress Update:<br>
"The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) continues to coordinate development of agency public access plans providing immediate and free public access to federally funded research publications and data through the Subcommittee on Open Science. Since OSTP updated the Open Government Commitment Tracker in August 2023, agencies with research and development expenditures have submitted their updated or newly developed public access plans for OSTP review. Several agencies have publicly posted their plans for community engagement and comment. In addition, agencies have collaborated through the Subcommittee on Open Science to host joint public engagement opportunities, including through listening sessions, to share the status of public access policy development efforts and to receive input from the community. To provide updates on agency efforts to coordinate open science and public access policies and programs, CENDI, an interagency working group of senior scientific and technical information managers, has refreshed open.science.gov, a site developed and maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI).
