Progress Update: 

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)’s Community Crisis Response Partnerships program began in FY 2022 to support communities in creating or enhancing existing mobile crisis response teams to divert adults, children, and youth experiencing mental health crises from law enforcement in high-need communities. This program recognizes a high-need community as one where mobile crisis services are absent or inconsistent, where most mental health crises are responded to by first responders, and/or where first responders who are not behavioral health crisis specialists or adequately trained or equipped to defuse mental health crises. Grant recipients utilize SAMHSA’s National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care: Best Practice Toolkit as a guide for best practices in the delivery of mobile crisis services. In FY 2022, SAMHSA awarded twelve grant recipients in its initial cohort, and in FY 2023, SAMHSA awarded a second cohort of thirteen grant recipients, for a total of twenty-five active grant recipients.
