Progress Update:<br>
Funding has been requested to support a full redesign of the Archives.gov website. At this time, funding for the project is still pending approval. The planned modernization of Archives.gov will include upgrading the websiteâ€™s content management system to the latest version (i.e. Drupal 10), and redesigning the layout of the website (including the homepage and all interior pages) to meet modern web design, user experience, and information architecture best practices. The project will leverage agile and user centered design methodologies, whereby the design direction and functionality of the website will be significantly influenced by the continuous feedback of key internal and external stakeholders. Methods such as benchmarking, user research, user interviews, focus groups, and product demos will be used to gather feedback throughout the project lifecycle, in order to ensure that the end result meets the needs of website users and other key project stakeholders.
