The Working Group is employing a variety of outreach and communications methods to offer diverse ways for the public to engage, and to ensure meaningful public participation in the review of the race and ethnicity standards. Outreach efforts to date include three White House blog posts, a dedicated public website (spd15revision.gov), bi-monthly listening sessions where the public can share input with the members of the Working Group, participation in professional conferences and stakeholder convenings, and a 90-day Federal Register Notice that resulted in over 20,000 public comments.
