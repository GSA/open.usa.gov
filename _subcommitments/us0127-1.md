Progress Update: <br>
In December of 2023, a Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council released a report outlining areas where further work by agencies and academic researchers could improve benefit-cost analysis. That report specifically noted areas of further research related to reducing administrative burden that would improve agency analysis in this space. 
 
In January 2024, OMB released a call for information on agencies' efforts to support Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) goals, including accomplishments and planned initiatives to reduce burden on the program. This data call for the FY 2023 Information Collection Budget will form the basis for this year's report on agency efforts to reduce administrative burdens. 
 
OMB has also continued to review paperwork requests under the Paperwork Reduction Act with an eye towards reducing administrative burdens.<br>
