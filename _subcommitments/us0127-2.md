Progress Update: <br>
IRS modernization efforts have put reducing administrative burden at the forefront, including through the development of the Direct File pilot (a free, voluntary IRS-run electronic filing system) and its efforts to digitize a wide range of IRS forms.
 
USDA announced in January that most farm loan borrowers will be able to make payments to their direct loans online through the Pay My Loan feature on farmers.gov.<br>
