On July 10th, 2023, the Administration released a report summarizing the progress across the Federal government to identify and reduce burdens that individuals, families, and small businesses face every day when interacting with government programs. This new report provides concrete actions agencies have taken, such as:

  * The Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to proactively reduce burden on individuals using mobile drivers’ licenses as identification when flying
  * The Social Security Administration’s efforts to simplify and streamline recertification of disability status (also known as Continuing Disability Review)
  * The Internal Revenue Service's efforts to improve IRS technology and deliver a modernized taxpayer experience by exploring new services, such as a free, voluntary IRS-run electronic filing system (also called Direct File)

Other examples can be found in the full report:
