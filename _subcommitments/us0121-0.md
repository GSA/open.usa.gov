aug_2023_progress: Progress for this commitment include a number of activities outlined below:<br>(a) In February 2023, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget shared a summary of learnings and potential recommendations on broadening public engagement in the Federal regulatory process (link below).<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/broadening-public-engagement-in-the-federal-regulatory-process/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/broadening-public-engagement-in-the-federal-regulatory-process/</a><br><br>OIRA invited feedback on the recommendations and held a listening session on March 7, 2023. The feedback from those engagements can be found at the link below.<br><br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Public-Submitted-Material-Posting-Versions.zip">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Public-Submitted-Material-Posting-Versions.zip</a><br><br>OIRA published guidance drawing from that past engagement on Broadening Public Participation and Community Engagement in the Regulatory Process on July 19, 2023. That guidance can be found here:<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Broadening-Public-Participation-and-Community-Engagement-in-the-Regulatory-Process.pdf">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Broadening-Public-Participation-and-Community-Engagement-in-the-Regulatory-Process.pdf</a><br><br>(b) OMB is identifying promising practices across agency activities and lifting up efforts that can be replicated. This inventory is available for federal agency staff.<br><br>(c) OIRA is also developing guidance on how OIRA staff schedule and conduct meetings with the public while regulations are under OIRA review. OIRA released draft guidance related to this effort here:<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ModernizingEOSection2eDraftGuidance.pdf">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ModernizingEOSection2eDraftGuidance.pdf</a><br><br>OIRA also invited public comments on the draft guidance, which can be viewed here:<br><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/OMB-2022-0011/comments">https://www.regulations.gov/docket/OMB-2022-0011/comments</a><br><br>Last, OIRA held a public listening session to hear from members of the public on the proposed guidance for how OIRA staff schedule and conduct meetings with the public. Those videos are posted here:<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/modernizing-regulatory-review/hearing-from-you-how-oira-meets-with-the-public/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/modernizing-regulatory-review/hearing-from-you-how-oira-meets-with-the-public/</a><br><br>OIRA is currently finalizing this draft guidance.

Progress Update: <br>
Consistent with the guidance on Broadening Public Participation and Community Engagement in the Regulatory Process released on July 19, 2023, agencies included information on their public participation efforts in the Federal Government’s biannual release of the Regulatory Agenda. OMB publicly highlighted particularly noteworthy instances of agency public participation efforts and continues to invite public feedback on this process. OIRA also issued and received public comment on draft guidance on how to improve OIRA’s process for meeting with members of the public regarding regulatory actions under OIRA review.  Solicitation of public input included a more than three-hour listening session on May 4, 2023, to hear from stakeholders about the proposed guidance.  Reflecting that feedback, OIRA issued final guidance on December 20, 2023, along with an explanation and response to input. Both documents describe a number of steps OIRA is taking to encourage feedback from a broad array of stakeholders through these meetings, including making it easier to request meetings through OIRA’s online portal; providing plain language information on OIRA’s website to help individuals prepare for these meetings; posting a video how-to guide (in English and a Spanish version by OIRA Administrator Richard Revesz) on how to request meetings; and offering periodic and accessible public trainings on effective participation in these meetings.<br>
