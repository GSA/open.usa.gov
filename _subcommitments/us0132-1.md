aug_2023_progress: In January 2023, the National Science and Technology Council released a Framework for Federal Scientific Integrity Policy and Practice, which advises agencies on establishing or strengthening scientific integrity policies and provides a framework for regular assessment and iterative improvement of policies and practices to advance and sustain the work of protecting Federal science and enabling Federal scientists (link below).<br><br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-2023-Framework-for-Federal-Scientific-Integrity-Policy-and-Practice.pdf">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-2023-Framework-for-Federal-Scientific-Integrity-Policy-and-Practice.pdf</a>

Progress Update: 

Following the January 2023 release of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Framework for Federal Scientific Integrity Policy and Practice, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has been working with federal agencies to update or develop their scientific integrity policies to align with the Framework. These activities have been coordinated through the NSTC Subcommittee on Scientific Integrity (SOSI).
OSTP and SOSI have also worked to create opportunities to engage the research community and the public on efforts to strengthen federal scientific integrity policies and practices. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), on behalf of the federal agencies and departments participating SOSI, held two public listening sessions to hear from members of the public about recommendations, issues and concerns related to Federal department and agency implementation of the NSTC Framework for Federal Scientific Integrity Policy and Practice. In addition, agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Social Security Administration (SSA) have issued Requests for Information on their draft policies. OSTP released its first Scientific Integrity Policy in June 2023, modeled after the Framework.
