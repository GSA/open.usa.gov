Progress Update: 

As part of the Justice Department’s ongoing work to improve public safety and advance accountability in law enforcement, on December 18, 2023 the U.S. Department of Justice launched the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database (NLEAD), a centralized repository of official records documenting instances of misconduct as well as commendations and awards for federal law enforcement officers. The NLEAD is accessible only to authorized users to help determine suitability and eligibility of candidates for law enforcement positions. As required by the Executive Order, on an annual basis, the Justice Department, through its Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), will publish a public report containing aggregated and anonymized data to maintain transparency and accountability. The NLEAD connects all federal law enforcement agencies under one accountability infrastructure. With the NLEAD, law enforcement agency hiring personnel will have more accurate and complete information about misconduct in a job candidate’s past. Agencies can then make more informed hiring decisions, which enhances both accountability and public safety.
