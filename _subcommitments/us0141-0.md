title:  "To strengthen transparency about expected contract opportunities and accessibility to this information, agencies are working with OMB to identify a common list of procurement information to include in agency forecasts of contracting opportunities in order for potential contractors, and especially those in underserved communities, to effectively prepare for future Federal contract competitions. Promising practices are being assessed for moving from a static posting of forecasting data at the beginning of the fiscal year to a timelier and more dynamic model that involves more regular posting of new information on a rolling basis as requirements are identified. User friendly search and filter functions are being explored to improve visibility and accessibility across agency forecasts over time so that entities interested in particular market segments can find relevant information more easily in the official System for Award Management (SAM.gov). The Biden-Harris Administration commits to implementation of these initiatives over the next two years with quarterly progress reporting on https://performance.gov/pma."

OSDBU Forecast of Contracting Opportunities - fbf.gov  
More information is available at: [https://www.acquisitiongateway.gov/forecast](https://www.acquisitiongateway.gov/forecast)

The goal of this tool is to provide a nationwide dashboard of upcoming federal contracting opportunities. All projected procurements are subject to revision or cancellation. Final decisions on the extent of competition, small business participation, estimated value, or any aspect of the procurement are made if/when a solicitation is posted to SAM.gov. Forecast data is for planning purposes only and is not a commitment by the Government to purchase the described products and/or services. Address questions regarding a planned procurement to the point of contact listed in the record.

7 federal executive agencies use the tool:

  * General Services Administration
  * Department of the Interior
  * Department of Labor
  * U.S. Small Business Administration
  * U.S. Office of Personnel Management
  * U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
  * U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
