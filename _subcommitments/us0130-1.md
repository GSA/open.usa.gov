Progress Update: 

FinCEN continues to provide guidance materials about the beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting requirements.  FinCEN published more than 80 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to assist the public with BOI reporting requirements, and most recently published new FAQs in January 2024.  FinCEN published its small entity compliance guide (Guide) for the final BOI Reporting Requirements Rule (Reporting Rule) in September 2023, and updated it in December 2023.  The Guide describes each of the Reporting Rule’s provisions in simple, easy-to-read language; answers key questions; and provides interactive checklists, infographics, and other tools to assist businesses in complying with BOI reporting requirements.  FinCEN also issued technical instructions to support reporting companies with filing their BOI reports.  FinCEN issued the final BOI Access and Safeguards Rule (Access Rule) in December 2023.  The Access Rule prescribes the circumstances under which BOI may be disclosed to authorized recipients, and how it must be protected.  FinCEN will next engage in a rulemaking to revise FinCEN’s customer due diligence (CDD) rule, consistent with the requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act.
