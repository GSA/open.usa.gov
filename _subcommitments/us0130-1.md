The Treasury Department continues to release guidance related to beneficial ownership information reporting and access on its dedicated site linked below. Since the release of NAP 5, updates to the public include informational videos about beneficial ownership reporting, answers to frequently asked questions, and key dates for reporting. Treasury officials have also testified before Congress on CTA implementation and participated in a public meeting with relevant stakeholders in law enforcement, financial institutions, and industry groups to ensure that small businesses understand the new beneficial ownership information reporting requirements and solicit feedback on CTA implementation.
