aug_2023_progress: Over 90% of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's historic funding will be deployed by non-federal partners. In the past, too many communities have lacked the resources to apply for and deploy transformative infrastructure opportunities. While many funding streams in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law specifically set aside funds for underserved communities, the White House Infrastructure Implementation Team has also been engaging states, local governments, Tribal governments, territories, federal agencies, philanthropy, and others to leverage all available resources to quickly deliver the necessary technical assistance and capacity to underserved communities.

54 states and territories have appointed state infrastructure coordinators, responding to the call from Senior Advisor to the President and White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu to appoint an individual to coordinate efforts in a state along with serving as a single point of contact for the White House Infrastructure Implementation Team.  This structure has enabled closer coordination between federal and state implementation efforts. 

The White House has also created a suite of resources on build.gov that highlights programs that help communities navigate programs and resources that can help them deliver infrastructure projects. Build.gov also has resources for state, local, Tribal and territorial governments including a guidebook to each of the nearly 400 federal programs in BIL, a regularly updated list of open funding opportunities, resources specifically for Tribal governments, rural communities, territories, and a technical assistance guidebook. In September, the White House will bring technical assistance providers to the White House for a training. Additionally, the White House and federal agencies routinely engage with state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to share information, provide policy updates, and gather feedback.

Progress Update: 

The White House continues to create a suite of resources to help communities navigate programs that can help them deliver infrastructure projects. It built a "Thriving Community" network to help Cabinet agencies coordinate strategy, collaborate across initiatives, and target deployment of a full range of Federal place-based technical assistance and capacity-building resources to urban, rural, and Tribal communities experiencing a history of economic distress and systemic disinvestment. This effort includes resources to help disadvantaged communities with grant and financial management, pre-development assistance, community engagement, planning, and project delivery support. The Administration released a Technical Assistance Guide in September 2023 to help communities get access to the programs, processes, and resources that provide targeted support to a community, region, organization, or other beneficiary to help them access and deploy federal funding to deliver results. Further the White House is working with agency partners to quickly deliver the necessary technical assistance and capacity to underserved communities, ranging from the interagency Thriving Communities initiative to the Local Infrastructure Hub established by philanthropy and nongovernmental organizations.
