Progress Update: 

Through funds made available in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education's Office of Safe and Supportive Schools has awarded 264 grants to more than 40 states to increase the supply of school-based mental health professionals under the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant and the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration (MHSPD) Grant Programs. This initial activity of selecting and awarding grants is now completed as is this Open Government sub-commitment. The program has moved into a new phase of grant management where the grant awardees will implement their five year plans.
