NARA reached out and engaged with internal and external stakeholders in the African American and Puerto Rican communities and established effective channels of communication to get their feedback on NARA services related to the description of holdings, digitization, and collaborative projects. NARA used that feedback to develop digitization and collaboration projects to enhance content and services.
