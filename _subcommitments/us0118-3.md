aug_2023_progress: NARA reached out and engaged with internal and external stakeholders in the African American and Puerto Rican communities and established effective channels of communication to get their feedback on NARA services related to the description of holdings, digitization, and collaborative projects. NARA used that feedback to develop digitization and collaboration projects to enhance content and services.

Progress Update:<br>
"Since July, 2021, NARA has chartered a Reparative Description and Digitization Working Group (RDDWG), composed of representative individuals from across the agency. In addition to its emphasis on supporting and enhancing NARA’s long standing archival descriptive program and best practices, the RDDWG was tasked with additional primary functions. Most significantly, those functions included working to establish ongoing relationships with external community representatives, in cooperation with the NARA Equity Team. They also included identifying records that are of highest interest to underserved communities for reparative and enhanced description, digitization, and community engagement.

The RDDWG has developed an engagement model to identify and collaborate with internal and external stakeholders. During FY 22 and FY 23, the group engaged in stakeholder meetings with representatives of the African American and Puerto Rican communities, and have since built project plans and descriptive goals utilizing input gathered. To date, the RDDWG has collaborated with offices at NARA to accomplish the following:

Archival Description:
* [Created Guiding Principles for Reparative Description](https://www.archives.gov/research/reparative-description/principles)
* Created [Appendix to NARA’s Lifecycle Data Requirements Guide](https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/lcdrg/appendix) for Preferred and non-preferred terms
* Created processes and training materials for NARA staff based on approved terms for reparative description, to be incorporated into NARA’s archival description program
* Published [preferred term updates](https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/lcdrg/appendix#list-non-preferred-and-preferred-terms) based on feedback from African American and Puerto Rican community stakeholders
* In its first year of pilot operations, NARA reviewed approximately 9,000 catalog descriptions, which contributed to achieving [NARA Strategic Goal 1.3](https://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/strategic-plan/strategic-plan-2022-2026#toc-strategic-goal-1-make-access-happen)

Stakeholder Engagement: Digitization
 * Identified high priority records for digitization based on internal and external stakeholder engagement
* Created three digitization proposals for holdings from NARA’s Office of Research Services relating to the African American ([14,000 digital objects in RG 228 Records of the Committee on Fair Employment Practice, 1940–1946](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/555) and [RG 105 Records of Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, 1861-1880](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/434) digitization work in progress) and [Puerto Rican communities](https://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2022/11/29/this-just-in-three-new-series-relating-to-puerto-rico-fully-digitized-and-available-online/) (work continues into FY 24)

Stakeholder Engagement: Community Driven Missions
*  Monitored work on existing missions utilizing NARA’s pre-existing ‘Citizen Archivist’ program:
    * Record Group 94: [Carded Records Showing Military Service of Soldiers Who Fought in Volunteer Organizations During the American Civil War](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/300398), [1890 - 1912](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/300398), a subset of records labeled as “[United States Colored Troops (USCT)](https://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/300398?q=%22united%20states%20colored%20troops%22),” documenting the military service of Black Union soldiers
    * Tagging and Transcription of Chinese Heritage Records
* Established new project/mission through University of Puerto Rico stakeholder collaborative efforts: Record Group 29 1935 Agricultural Census of Puerto Rico records enhanced description project. [Bulk downloads of these records](https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/catalog-bulk-downloads/agricultural-census-puerto-rico) are available on Archives.gov\
