Progress Update: 

In addition to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance released in December 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing several changes to the OMB guidance for Federal financial assistance that addresses whistleblower protections and cooperation with Inspectors General. OMB is proposing a new section of 2 CFR that addresses whistleblower protections for recipients of Federal financial assistance, stipulating that recipient employees can not be discriminated against for disclosing fraud or mismanagement. OMB is also updating the guidance to require recipients to disclose any credible evidence of a violation of Federal criminal law potentially affecting the Federal award to the agencyâ€™s Office of Inspector General, in addition to the current requirement to report this information only to the Federal agencies.

Evidence: 

None.
