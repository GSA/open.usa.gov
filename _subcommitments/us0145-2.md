Progress Update: 

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development completed a comprehensive review in April 2023 of HUD regulations, policies, and guidance to identify ways to reduce unnecessary and discriminatory denials and exclusions for people who have past criminal records but who pose no danger or risk to their communities. That review found that several of HUD’s regulations and sub-regulatory provisions could be improved and clarified to ensure that public housing agencies and HUD-affiliated owners are following recognized best practices. As a result of that review, HUD is amending the Department’s regulations governing housing vouchers, public housing, and HUD’s multifamily housing programs to ensure that applicants are not automatically denied simply because they have a criminal record, but instead are given a fair and full individualized review. In October 2023, HUD also announced amendments to a regulation that would eliminate the department’s restrictions on the use of fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or certain other convictions by Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grantees and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies. This change would ensure that FHIP and FHAP funded entities are able to fully investigate criminal background screening policies that are potentially discriminatory under federal civil rights laws by using testers with actual criminal backgrounds.
