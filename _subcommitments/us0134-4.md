aug_2023_progress: OMB has made extensive updates to its Annual Improper Payments data call, significantly reducing the burden on the agencies completing the survey, and allowing agencies the opportunity to provide more detailed information on how they are addressing their improper payments. In June OMB published an Illustrative Response Guide providing best practices for completing the free text portions of the Annual Improper Payments data call to assure agency responses are complete, accurate, and easy to understand.  OMB is also updating how the results of the annual survey is displayed on <a href="https://www.paymentaccuracy.gov/">https://www.paymentaccuracy.gov/</a> to enhance the readability and user experience.  The annual improper payment results will be posted on <a href="https://www.paymentaccuracy.gov/">https://www.paymentaccuracy.gov/</a> in the fall.

Progress Update: 

OMB developed a new automatic feature that alerts agencies of potential errors in their draft data submissions providing agencies with an additional opportunity to make corrections and improve the overall quality and accuracy of the information published on payment accuracy.gov. In addition, OMB updated the display of agency payment integrity data on paymentaccuracy.gov by streamlining and unifying the display of payment integrity data across all agencies and programs. This revised display was published in November 2023 to enhance the readability of the agency dashboard and improve the overall user experience. OMB continues to explore additional opportunities to make improvements to payment integrity reporting.
