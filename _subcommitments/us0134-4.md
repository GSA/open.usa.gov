OMB has made extensive updates to its Annual Improper Payments data call, significantly reducing the burden on the agencies completing the survey, and allowing agencies the opportunity to provide more detailed information on how they are addressing their improper payments. In June OMB published an Illustrative Response Guide providing best practices for completing the free text portions of the Annual Improper Payments data call to assure agency responses are complete, accurate, and easy to understand.  OMB is also updating how the results of the annual survey is displayed on PaymentAccuracy.gov to enhance the readability and user experience.  The annual improper payment results will be posted on PaymentAccuracy.gov in the fall.
