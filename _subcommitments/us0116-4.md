Progress Update:<br>
In January 2023, the OSTP announced 2023 as a Year of Open Science to advance national open science policies and promote the adoption of open science. Agency activities and engagements throughout the year focused on a number of key themes, including activities to incentivize the adoption of open science practices. To recognize stories of federally supported open science success, OSTP launched the Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge on Challenge.gov, which closed in December 2023. The Challenge received nearly 150 submissions and OSTP is in the process of evaluating responses. Agencies have also participated in discussions with the leaders in the academic research community around incentive structures to recognize and reward open research practices. In January 2024, NASA sponsored a workshop by the Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS) on modernizing tenure, promotion, review, and hiring to reward open scholarship and public access.<br>
