Progress Update: 

The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program is a $42.45 billion state grant program authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. States and territories will use the funding to deploy or upgrade broadband networks to ensure that everyone has access to reliable, affordable, high-speed Internet service. Once deployment goals are met, remaining funding can be used on high-speed Internet adoption, training, and workforce development efforts, among other eligible use.
