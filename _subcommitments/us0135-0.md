OMB is implementing the plan outlined in the Office of Management and Budget’s 2021 report to Congress to build the Federal Program Inventory through the completion of a series of pilots. In the summer and fall of 2023, OMB will implement “Pilot A: Establish a method for improving and utilizing assistance listings as units of analysis.” This pilot will focus on testing whether the infrastructure (systems, policies, people, and processes) that support the assistance listings at SAM.gov could serve as a basis for the structure of the inventory for federal financial assistance programs. In June, GSA released guidance to agencies including guidelines and reporting requirements for reviewing and updating all assistance listings. These updated assistance listings will form the basis of an initial version of the inventory, limited to federal financial assistance, that will be made public later this year.
