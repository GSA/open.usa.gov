Progress Update:<br>
"The new Catalog and the new optical character recognition tool launched in Beta in September 2022 and in production in November 2022.The Catalog launched new improved logging and web analytics measurement features for improved insights into Catalog user behavior. A new Catalog customer experience survey launched in December 2023 to inform user experience enhancements under development. The Catalog survey is available at: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NARAnewcatfb](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NARAnewcatfb)

The new Archivist of The United States, Colleen Shogan, has expressed her strong interest in digital public engagement and specifically the user experience with NARAâ€™s online Catalog. She established an interoffice executive working group and charged them with 6 month improvement windows to ensure that NARA makes strides to substantially impact the user experience for the better. Our first 6 month sprint concludes in June 2024. Initial plans include user experience research, pilot projects that explore the use of artificial intelligence for improving digital access, and digital collaboration projects."
