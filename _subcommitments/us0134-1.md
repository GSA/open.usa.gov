aug_2023_progress: In FY23 OMB launched the Fraud & Payment Integrity Symposium series, creating a forum for two-way dialogue across the Federal government to discuss and share resources available to Federal program staff to prevent, detect, and reduce fraud and improper payments. Since February OMB has hosted three symposiums with a fourth planned for September. In addition to the symposium series, OMB has been working with their fellow Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) Principals to develop a three-year plan focused on working with agencies to combat fraud and improper payments. In March the White House released President Biden’s Sweeping Pandemic Anti-Fraud Proposal:<br><br>Going After Systemic Fraud, Taking on Identity Theft, Helping Victims (link below) outlining the Administration’s three-part Pandemic Anti-Fraud proposal highlighting the need for a “a bipartisan response to punish those who engaged in major and systemic fraud against the American people during a time of national emergency, to put in place stronger fraud and identity theft prevention going forward, and to hold harmless those Americans who were innocent victims of identity theft”.<br><br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-sweeping-pandemic-anti-fraud-proposal-going-after-systemic-fraud-taking-on-identity-theft-helping-victims/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-sweeping-pandemic-anti-fraud-proposal-going-after-systemic-fraud-taking-on-identity-theft-helping-victims/</a>
