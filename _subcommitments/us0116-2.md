Included in the 2022 OSTP Public Access Memo is the guidance that, “In consultation with OMB, federal agencies should allow researchers to include reasonable publication costs and costs associated with submission, curation, management of data, and special handling instructions as allowable expenses in all research budgets.”

Agencies are now working on their public access policies that allow for these reasonable costs. These policies are expected to be publicly posted by December 31, 2024 and will go into effect by December 31, 2025. To date, the National Institute of Health released updated guidance for including these costs and evidence of that guidance can be found here:
