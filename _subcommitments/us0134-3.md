aug_2023_progress: In FY23 OMB made updates to the quarterly High Priority Program scorecards asking agencies to provide the details of the actions the agency took to prevent overpayments during the current reporting period, and those planned for the following quarter. This update replaced the “Key Milestones” questions from prior year’s scorecards. Allowing the agencies to report on specific time periods (i.e. a quarter) in more detail than they were previously able. In addition to the updated scorecards, in June OMB held a meeting with the 11 agencies that oversee the 29 High Priority Programs and continues to engage with the agencies on their efforts to reduce improper payments. Current and past quarterly High Priority Program scorecards can be found on PaymentAccuracy.gov.
