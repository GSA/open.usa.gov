In January 2023, the White House declared 2023 a Year of Open Science, a multi-agency initiative coordinated through the Subcommittee on Open Science to advance national open science policies (see links below). Several activities center on engaging early-stage researchers and researchers from historically excluded backgrounds, including a series of listening sessions with early career researchers to understand and elevate their needs, priorities, and experiences in advancing open science.
