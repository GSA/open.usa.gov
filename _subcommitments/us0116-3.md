Progress Update:<br>
In January 2023, the White House declared 2023 a Year of Open Science, a multi-agency initiative coordinated through the Subcommittee on Open Science to advance national open science policies (see links below). Several activities center on engaging early-stage researchers and researchers from historically excluded backgrounds. Since OSTP’s August 2023 update to the Open Government Commitment Tracker, and as part of a Year of Open Science, NSF issued a Request for Information on improving equity throughout the research lifecycle, making data and opportunities available to all researchers. Agencies have continued to advance training opportunities to diverse communities to promote open science skill building. For example, in December 2023, NASA released its openly available Open Science 101 curriculum with a goal to train 20,000 scientists and researchers over the next five years, while working to reduce barriers to entry.<br>
