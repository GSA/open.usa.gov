The Standard Application Process (SAP) launched and started accepting applications in 2022. It provides a repository of metadata describing confidential data assets from OMB-recognized federal statistical agencies and units—and offers a streamlined, standardized process to request access to those assets for evidence-building purposes. With the initial functionality made public, the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy and OMB is overseeing the application moving forward, in alignment with M-23-04.
