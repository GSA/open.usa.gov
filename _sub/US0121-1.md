commitment_narrative: "Progress for this commitment include a number of activities outlined below:

(a) In February 2023, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget shared a summary of learnings and potential recommendations on broadening public engagement in the Federal regulatory process (link below). 
 
https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/broadening-public-engagement-in-the-federal-regulatory-process/
 
OIRA invited feedback on the recommendations and held a listening session on March 7, 2023. The feedback from those engagements can be found at the link below.

(b) OMB is identifying promising practices across agency activities and lifting up efforts that can be replicated. This inventory will be available for federal agency staff.
 
(c) OIRA is also developing guidance on how OIRA staff schedule and conduct meetings with the public while regulations are under OIRA review. OIRA released draft guidance related to this effort here:

OIRA also invited public comments on the draft guidance, which can be viewed here:

Last, OIRA held a public listening session to hear from members of the public on the proposed guidance for how OIRA staff schedule and conduct meetings with the public. Those videos are posted here:

(d) OIRA continues to engage civil society organizations to help generate ideas for public engagement guidance as part of the Open Government Initiative series (link below).
