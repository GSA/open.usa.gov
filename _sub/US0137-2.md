Reporting on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) implementation, which includes reporting on awards for a subset of BIL programs and instructions for how members of the public can download the full dataset of all BIL awards via USASpending.gov, can be found at: [https://d2d.gsa.gov/report/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-bil-maps-dashboard](https://d2d.gsa.gov/report/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-bil-maps-dashboard). The Office of Science and Technology Policy is continuing to explore the completeness and comprehensiveness of subaward data for use in reporting.
