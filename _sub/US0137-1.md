commitment_narrative: "In March 2023, the Subcommittee on Equitable Data (SED) released its Progress on Implementation of the Recommendations of the Equitable Data Working Group (linke below), which included an update on how data and evidence are being used to track progress on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) implementation. On page 23 of the report, it noted that: “The SED’s Equitable Federal Funding Interagency Working Group (EFFIWG) created a process to scope and answer emergent, actionable research questions to inform equitable delivery of the BIL. These ‘rapid equity assessments’ represent discrete projects that use equitable data to improve processes and policies along the entire grant life cycle. To date, the EFFIWG, in collaboration with agency program staff, has conducted many rapid equity assessments including those that evaluate the geographic patterns of programs directly serving Americans and the distribution of project announcements throughout the country to better understand patterns of access among underserved communities.
