### Submit Your Recommendation

You can submit your recommended commitments here to contribute to the co-creation of the new U.S. National Action Plan. Recommendations will be considered based the selection criteria outlined on the [co-creation page](/national-action-plan/co-creation/#considerations-for-selecting-commitments) (solving a problem, demand, feasibility, alignment, openness). 

Recommendations can also be sent by email to [opengov@ostp.eop.gov](mailto:opengov@ostp.eop.gov) or by participating in one of the [co-creation workshops](/meeting/november-2022-public-engagement-opening-the-federal-regulatory-process-to-more-voices/).
