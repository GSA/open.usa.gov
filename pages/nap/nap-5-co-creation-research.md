### Research

Please help identify existing reports, recommendations, and landscape analysis to help us inform a comprehensive, responsive, and evidence-based co-creation process.

Public input for the [co-creation](../) [outreach phase](../outreach/) is divided into three sections. You can provide input for each. If you have an existing compilation of recommendations, use the research form on this page. If you have civil society organizations, communities, experts, and more inclusive voices to suggest, please use the [Community Outreach Form](../outreach-form/). If you have individual problem statements, please submit each one using the [Problem Statement Form](../problem-statements/).
