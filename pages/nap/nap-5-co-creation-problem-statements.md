### Problem Statements

Please explain the problem that open government can address. Identify unmet needs, broken processes, and problems around transparency, participation, accountability. Explain how open government commitments can deliver a more responsive, equitable, and accountable government for and by the people

Public input for the [co-creation](../) [outreach phase](../outreach/) is divided into three sections. You can provide input for each. If you have individual problem statements, please submit each one using this form. If you have an existing compilation of recommendations, use the [Research Form](../research-form). If you have civil society organizations, communities, experts, and more inclusive voices to suggest, please use the [Community Outreach Form](../outreach-form/).
