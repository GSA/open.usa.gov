## What we do
GSA helps keep the nation safe by providing tools, equipment, and non-tactical vehicles to the U.S. military, and providing state and local governments with law enforcement equipment, firefighting and rescue equipment, and disaster recovery products and services.

GSA leads the way in green building design, construction, retrofit and sustainable operations and maintenance. GSA is building a 21st century government that procures and manages technology solutions in smart, secure, and affordable ways.
