#### Fifth Open Government National Action Plan
_Updated April 29 2024_


Since releasing the [Fifth Open Government National Action Plan](../) in December 2022, the Federal Government began implementing the many commitments outlined within it. In advance of publishing progress toward those commitments, the Open Government Working Group is releasing the schedule of virtual engagement sessions below with registration links. Each session will focus on one or two themes and during the session, agency representatives will report on the progress of implementation and upcoming milestones for commitments within the theme. These virtual engagement sessions will also offer the opportunity for civil society stakeholders and the public to provide feedback and ask questions regarding the risks and challenges related to implementation. We look forward to collaborating with you.

Registration information for these events will be posted here in the weeks leading up to them. We look forward to collaborating with you.

### Upcoming Meeting:

**May 2nd** - The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is shaping a new Federal framework for public participation and community engagement (PPCE), aimed at helping Federal agencies more broadly and meaningfully engage with all members of the public, including underserved communities. **OMB is <a href="https://www.performance.gov/participation/">seeking public feedback</a> on developing this framework, with written input due by May 17**. We want to ensure that all members of this community are aware of this opportunity to provide your expertise and insights. In addition, the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/open-government-initiative">U.S. Open Government Secretariat</a>, OMB, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) are pleased to invite you to a listening session on **Leveraging Federal Participation and Engagement to Drive Open Government on Thursday, May 2, from 1:30-3:00 pm ET**. After brief presentations from OSTP, OMB, and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), attendees will have the opportunity to provide feedback and ideas on a Federal framework for PPCE.

**May 10th** - On April 26, 2024 the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) released a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/26/2024-08970/notice-of-intent-to-establish-a-federal-advisory-committee-and-call-for-nominations">Federal Registar Notice</a> detailing our intent to establish a Open Government Federal Advisory Committee (OG FAC), as well as a call for nominations for members of that commmittee. The Open Government Secretariat supports ensuring a more transparent, responsive and inclusive Federal Government. This is done by providing channels for members of the public to regularly engage with their government. The OG FAC will advise GSA in its endeavor to increase the public's access to data, to better advance equity, engage the public in the regulatory process, make government records more accessible, and improve the delivery of government services and benefits through expert advice. The OG FAC will serve as an advisory body to GSA on GSA Open Government initiatives including GSA's creation, implementation and monitoring of U.S. Open Government National Action Plans (NAPs) and commitment themes. The initial focus for the OG FAC will be to provide advice to GSA on the development of NAP 6, Open Government Policy, and Public Engagement. The OG FAC will advise GSA's Administrator on emerging open government issues, challenges and opportunities to support GSA's Open Government Secretariat. We are hosting a virtual Question and Answer (Q&A) session on May 10, 2024 at 1:00pm ET. The purpose of the Q&A session is to answer questions on the selection process and timeline. The Q&A session will be recorded and will be posted to the GSA YouTube Channel, on the Open Government Secretariat Playlist.
