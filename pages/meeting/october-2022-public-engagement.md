### Invitation

As part of the U.S. Open Government National Action Plan [co-creation](/national-action-plan/co-creation/), the Federal government is continuing to engage with civil society to craft themes and specific commitments. To that end, we are organizing two engagement sessions to provide updates to civil society members on the status of the National Action Plan, to gather feedback on draft themes and commitment areas, and discuss new ideas for themes and commitments.
 
We are planning two sessions: on October 27th from 10am to 12pm ET and October 28th from 11:30am to 1:30pm ET. The sessions will include discussions facilitated by White House staff, divided by potential themes in the National Action Plan. The themes under consideration for discussion include, among others:

1. Transforming customer experience and service delivery 
2. Improving access to government data, research, and information 
3. Engaging the public in the work of government
4. Countering corruption and ensuring government integrity and accountability to the public

A through line across all of these themes is advancing equity for, and engaging with, underserved communities. This is consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration’s central focus on supporting communities that have faced exclusion from social, economic, and civic life. We are also incorporating this through line in the process of developing National Action Plan commitments, building on outreach and engagement to underserved communities across Federal agencies since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration.

We are inviting up to two representatives per organization to join these sessions. We invite you to RSVP to join here:

* **Thursday, October 27th 10am – 12pm ET** - [Register for Zoom teleconference](https://gsa.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJItce6qpz8pG1IqBhOENfB_l-rLKMFiaq8)

Please feel free to share this invitation broadly with other partners you might work with. We also encourage written feedback you might have for the National Action Plan to be shared by email to [opengov@ostp.eop.gov](mailto:opengov@ostp.eop.gov).

This event will follow Chatham House rules, so that all participants feel comfortable sharing candid opinions, feedback, and suggestions. While we encourage attendees to share their individual perspective and feedback, we will not be seeking consensus recommendations at the events.
