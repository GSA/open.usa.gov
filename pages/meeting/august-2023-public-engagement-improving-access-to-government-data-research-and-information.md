## Agenda

The federal government collects vast amounts of data through its day-to-day activities, as well as through the federal statistical system. This repository of federal data best serves the American public and American government when the data are transparent, sufficiently detailed while still protecting privacy, and accessible to the American public. In the day one [Executive Order On Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/), the President noted that a “first step to promoting equity in Government action is to gather the data necessary to inform that effort.” We need a common base of shared information in order to align the efforts of federal, state, Tribal, local, and territorial governments; the nonprofit sector; private enterprise; community-based organizations; and academia. Increased access, transparency, and utility of government data can improve American lives, capture areas of concern, identify national issues, inform policy and legislation, and help in understanding the public’s needs.
We look forward to hearing from you about how the federal government can improve provision of data, research, and information as open government work continues.
