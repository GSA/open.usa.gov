### November 29th 2022 Virtual Public Engagement Session for the US Open Government National Action Plan

* Tuesday, November 29th 1–2pm ET - [Register for Zoom teleconference](https://gsa.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIsc-6hrjssGAmXbjc57QgTGOfmBgPOPkk)

### Invitation

The [White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/) invites you to attend an engagement session on data transparency and ways to improve accessibility and utility of government data.

This session concerns the fifth [U.S. National Action Plan for Open Government](https://open.usa.gov/) (National Action Plan), and will be held over Zoom on November 29, 2022 from 1 to 2pm ET. More details and the registration link are below.

### Background

The federal government collects vast amounts of data through its day-to-day activities, as well as through the federal statistical system. This repository of federal data best serves the American public and American government when the data are transparent, sufficiently detailed while still protecting privacy, and accessible to the American public.

To fulfill the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to transparent and equitable data, we are seeking input about how data can be more transparent, useful, and accessible. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy will hold an engagement session on November 29, 2022 from 1:00 to 2:00pm ET to get feedback from the public about proposed federal commitments to improve public access to data.

This session will inform the [development](https://open.usa.gov/national-action-plan/co-creation/) of the United States’ [Open Government National Action Plan](https://open.usa.gov/) – a set of public commitments the federal government is drafting with input from civil society to support a more equitable, transparent, and accountable government.     

At this session, we plan to further define commitments related to the following ideas brought up by participants in previous engagement sessions: 

* Strengthening access to government information through the Freedom of Information Act.
* Creating better feedback loops between data practitioners and federal data stewards

We hope that you can join us with members of the public to build on these suggestions and surface new ideas for how federal agencies can improve access to public data. While we encourage attendees to share their individual perspectives and feedback, we will not be seeking consensus recommendations at the event. Please note that the comments and views made by the individuals during the event are not representative of the White House.
