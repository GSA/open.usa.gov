## Agenda

The purpose of this session is for the government to brief out its status in completing commitments number 130.1, 130.2, 131, and 142 in the 5th U.S. Open Government National Action Plan (NAP).

Note: Our speaker from the Department of State was unable to attend the session, so an update on commitment 131 was not able to be provided.
