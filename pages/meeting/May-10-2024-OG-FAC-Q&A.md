## Agenda
On April 26, 2024 the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) released a [Federal Registar Notice](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/26/2024-08970/notice-of-intent-to-establish-a-federal-advisory-committee-and-call-for-nominations) detailing our intent to establish a Open Government Federal Advisory Committee (OG FAC), as well as a call for nominations for members of that commmittee. The Open Government Secretariat supports ensuring a more transparent, responsive and inclusive Federal Government. This is done by providing channels for members of the public to regularly engage with their government. The OG FAC will advise GSA in its endeavor to increase the public’s access to data, to better advance equity, engage the public in the regulatory process, make government records more accessible, and improve the delivery of government services and benefits through expert advice. The OG FAC will serve as an advisory body to GSA on GSA Open Government initiatives including GSA’s creation, implementation and monitoring of U.S. Open Government National Action Plans (NAPs) and commitment themes. The initial focus for the OG FAC will be to provide advice to GSA on the development of NAP 6, Open Government Policy, and Public Engagement. The OG FAC will advise GSA’s Administrator on emerging open government issues, challenges and opportunities to support GSA’s Open Government Secretariat. We are hosting a virtual Question and Answer (Q&A) session on May 10, 2024 at 1:00pm ET. The purpose of the Q&A session is to answer questions on the selection process and timeline. The Q&A session will be recorded and will be posted to the GSA YouTube Channel, on the Open Government Secretariat Playlist.
