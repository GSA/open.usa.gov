## Agenda
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is shaping a new Federal framework for public participation and community engagement (PPCE), aimed at helping Federal agencies more broadly and meaningfully engage with all members of the public, including underserved communities. OMB is [seeking public feedback](https://www.performance.gov/participation) on developing this framework, with written input due by May 17th 2024. We want to ensure that all members of this community are aware of this opportunity to provide your expertise and insights. In addition, the U.S. Open Government Secretariat, OMB, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) held a listening session on Leveraging Federal Participation and Engagement to Drive Open Government on Thursday, May 2nd 2024, from 1:30-3:00 pm ET. After brief presentations from OSTP, OMB, and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), attendees had the opportunity to provide feedback and ideas on a Federal framework for PPCE.
