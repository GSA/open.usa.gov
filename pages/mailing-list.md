We host two open government listservs. One is open to the public and civil society for the purposes of collaboration and discussion as well as coordination of government & civil society gatherings. The other is a government-only listserv and is primarily to disseminate government specific information on timelines and deadlines for the NAP and offer support as agencies work to achieve their commitments.
