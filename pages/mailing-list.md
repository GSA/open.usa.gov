We host two open government listservs. One is open to the public and civil society for the purposes of collaboration and discussion as well as coordination of government & civil society gatherings. The other is a government-only listserv and is primarily to disseminate government specific information on timelines and deadlines for the NAP and offer support as agencies work to achieve their commitments.

* **Public**: Please subscribe if you are interested in collaboration with federal and civil society open government partners.
	* Join here: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/us-open-government](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/us-open-government)
* **Government-only**: For those working on NAP commitments or involved in OpenGov initiatives for your agency. Join by emailing the OpenGov listserv.
	* Email [opengov-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov](mailto:opengov-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov?subject=Join: OpenGov) to join. Include "Join: OpenGov" in the subject line.
